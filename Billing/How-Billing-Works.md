# How billing works

##Prorata Billing

When you order a new service your first invoice will be prorated to the next first of the following month, if you order on or after the 23 of the month your first invoice will include the days until the next first of the month plus the whole consecutive month. Example: If you order a new service on day 15th, ante the service cost is $30/month, your first invoice will be for only $16.00 (day from 15, to the 1 next month). If you order the same service after 23, for example, 24, your first invoice will be $6.00 from the current month, plus $30 for the next month. After that, your payment day will be always the first of each month

##When invoices are generated?

Invoices are generated 1 in advance to Due Day

## How many days do I have to pay my invoices?

We expect to receive your payment no later than your Due Day, however, we understand that situations outside your control can affect your ability to pay on time, so we offer a 15 days grace period.

## What happens if I don't pay my invoice?

If we don't receive your full payment before the 15th day your will be automatically suspended (NO EXCEPTIONS), you can reactivate your suspended account by paying all the due amount

Suspensions and reactivations are fully automatic

After 30 days from Due Day, the service will be automatically terminated
